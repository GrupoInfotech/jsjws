
Known Issue for jsjws 1.0

- Currently 'jsjws 1.0' only supports ASCII code characters for
  JWS Header and Payload even though they can be represented any
  UTF-8 strings as defined in JWS specification.

- The 'jsjws 1.0' doesn't verify the matching between
  'alg' attribute value of JWS Header such like "ES256" and
  a signature algorithm of PKCS#1 signature value in JWS.

These issues may be solved in the future version of 'jsjws'.
